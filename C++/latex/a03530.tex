\doxysection*{Building with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019}

\doxysubsubsection*{0. Opening Visual Studio}

Open {\bfseries{Microsoft Visual Studio 2019}}. After seeing the splash/welcome screen,~\newline
 please click the button that reads {\bfseries{Open a local folder}}.

\doxysubsubsection*{1. Opening the dhart repository}

When the {\bfseries{Browse}} window appears, navigate to the {\ttfamily {\bfseries{dhart}}} folder~\newline
 (the repository that you had cloned) on your local machine.~\newline
 Then, navigate to {\ttfamily {\bfseries{src}}.}~\newline
 Click the {\bfseries{Select}} folder button to confirm.~\newline


\doxysubsubsection*{2. Revealing the Solution Explorer}

If the {\bfseries{Solution Explorer}} view is not already open, you may open by~\newline
 navigating to {\bfseries{View \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Solution Explorer}}, or alternatively,~\newline
 you can also use the {\bfseries{Ctrl + Alt + L}} shortcut to reveal Solution Explorer.~\newline
 Here, you can examine the sources imported by Visual Studio.~\newline


\doxysubsubsection*{3. Choosing a build version}

There are {\bfseries{two}} build versions for {\bfseries{dhart}}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item x64-\/\+Debug~\newline

\item x64-\/\+Release~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}

To change between build versions,~\newline
 navigate (move your cursor) over to the top-\/left portion of Visual Studio,~\newline
 and you will see a drop-\/down bar -- {\bfseries{x64-\/\+Debug}} is selected by default.

If you want to build the {\bfseries{x64-\/\+Release}} version of {\bfseries{dhart}},~\newline
 change the option in the drop-\/down bar to {\bfseries{x64-\/\+Release}}.

\doxysubsubsection*{4. Building the repository}

{\bfseries{We are now ready to build dhart.}}~\newline
 {\bfseries{CMake}} is used to aid in the compilation process.~\newline


To build, navigate to {\bfseries{Build \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Build All}},~\newline
 or you may use the {\bfseries{Ctrl + Shift + B}} keyboard shortcut.~\newline


{\bfseries{You have now built the sources for dhart.}}~\newline
 You can find the build files in {\ttfamily {\bfseries{./dhart/src/out/build/x64-\/\+Debug}}}
