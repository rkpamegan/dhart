{\bfseries{Contributing}}

To submit a merge request, you must include the output of the unittests and/or test cases if any source file is changed.

{\bfseries{Documentation}} Documentation is vital and must be done throughout the project, not the end.~\newline
 This includes examples for the use of each function.~\newline
 Styles for documentation can be found in the \mbox{\hyperlink{a03532}{Documentation Guide}}.

{\itshape Non-\/unity users}

\doxysection*{Python}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Sphinx
\item Numpydocs formatting
\item Must comply with doctest
\item Must include examples
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysection*{C++}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Doxygen
\item Must have a getting started page for each module
\item links to C\# and Python interfaces for each function, module
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysection*{Unity users}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Doxygen
\end{DoxyItemize}

There are three users of the codebase.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item People that will develop the foundation of the code (includes people like you).
\item People that will use the interfaces and our codebase as an API.
\item People that will use final products that are built with the codebase.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Each user group must be considered at each stage.

Coding standards are important, sometimes there is the ‘industry standard’ way.~\newline
 This is not always in alignment with the needs of the project or with research.~\newline
 It’s likely some things will be different, it should always be discussed and clarified.~\newline
 It should also be in the documentation.

\doxysection*{Python}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item pep8 convention in most cases (ask otherwise)
\item Do not make everything a class. A class should only be used when it is very clearly necessary. Algorithms should be done in a functional way.
\item Do not add dependencies without making an issue on why you need it (this goes for libraries that are not already listed as dependencies for the code)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysection*{C\#}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Naming Conventions and Coding Standards have to be well followed (\href{https://sites.google.com/site/wcfpandu/student-of-the-month/c-coding-standards-and-naming-conventions}{\texttt{ https\+://sites.\+google.\+com/site/wcfpandu/student-\/of-\/the-\/month/c-\/coding-\/standards-\/and-\/naming-\/conventions}})
\item Code general architecture should be discussed and well maintained.
