\doxysection*{Building with CMake\textquotesingle{}s standalone client (cmake-\/gui)}

Please ensure that you have installed\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (you will get the Visual C++ compiler along with it)
\item CMake
\end{DoxyItemize}

Also ensure that you have a local copy of the dhart repository.

\doxysubsubsection*{0. Opening cmake-\/gui}

Open the {\bfseries{CMake (cmake-\/gui)}} application. (Hit the Windows key, and type \textquotesingle{}CMake\textquotesingle{})

\doxysubsubsection*{1. Browse source...}

Hit the {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Browse Source...\textquotesingle{}}} button to the right of the~\newline
 {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Where is the source code\+:\textquotesingle{}}} text field.~\newline


\doxysubsubsection*{2. Selecting the source code directory}

In the window that appears (titled {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Enter Path to Source\textquotesingle{}}}),~\newline
 navigate to the local copy of {\bfseries{dhart}} on your machine.~\newline
 ~\newline
 Then, navigate to the {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}src\textquotesingle{}}} subdirectory. Click {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Select Folder\textquotesingle{}}}. ~\newline
 The {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Where is the source code\textquotesingle{}}} field should read\+:~\newline
 {\ttfamily C\+:/\mbox{[}YOUR\+\_\+\+PATH\+\_\+\+HERE\mbox{]}/dhart/src}

\doxysubsubsection*{3. Browse build...}

Hit the {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Browse Build...\textquotesingle{}}} button to the right of the~\newline
 {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Where to build the binaries\+:\textquotesingle{}}} text field.~\newline


\doxysubsubsection*{4. Selecting the build directory}

In the window that appears (titled {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Enter Path to Build\textquotesingle{}}}),~\newline
 navigate to the local copy of {\bfseries{dhart}} on your machine.~\newline
 ~\newline
 Then, navigate to the {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}build\textquotesingle{}}} subdirectory. Click {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Select Folder.\textquotesingle{}}} ~\newline
 The {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Where to build the binaries\textquotesingle{}}} field should read\+:~\newline
 {\ttfamily C\+:/\mbox{[}YOUR\+\_\+\+PATH\+\_\+\+HERE\mbox{]}/dhart/build}

\doxysubsubsection*{5. Confirming your configuration}

Hit the {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Configure\textquotesingle{}}} button in the left-\/center area of the cmake-\/gui window.

\doxysubsubsection*{6. Selecting compiler options}

In the dialogue box that appears,~\newline
 for the {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Specify the generator for this project\textquotesingle{}}} dropdown box, ensure that {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Visual Studio 16 2019\textquotesingle{}}} is selected.~\newline


Ensure that the {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Use default native compilers\textquotesingle{}}} radio button is selected. Do not fill in the remaining text fields.~\newline


Then, click {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Finish\textquotesingle{}}}.

\doxysubsubsection*{7. Building the repository/choosing a build version}

As stated previously, there are {\bfseries{two}} build versions for {\bfseries{dhart}}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item x64-\/\+Debug~\newline

\item x64-\/\+Release~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}

CMake will build the project.~\newline
 {\bfseries{Note\+: The build will appear to fail at first. }}~\newline
 The remainder of the directions for this step will rectify this,~\newline
 and you will also be able to select your desired build version. ~\newline
~\newline
 In the center of the cmake-\/gui window, you will see~\newline
 a {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Name\textquotesingle{}}} and {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Value\textquotesingle{}}} table, in red highlighting.~\newline


Next to {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}CMAKE\+\_\+\+CONFIGURATION\+\_\+\+TYPES\textquotesingle{}}}, click the text field~\newline
 that resides underneath the {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Value\textquotesingle{}}} column.~\newline


To select the build version,~\newline
 change the selected field to {\bfseries{Debug}}, for the x64-\/\+Debug version,~\newline
 or {\bfseries{Release}}, for the x64-\/\+Release version, whichever is desired.~\newline


Then, click {\bfseries{\textquotesingle{}Configure\textquotesingle{}}}.

The build files generated by CMake will reside in~\newline
 {\bfseries{{\ttfamily C\+:/\mbox{[}YOUR\+\_\+\+PATH\+\_\+\+HERE\mbox{]}/dhart/build}}}
